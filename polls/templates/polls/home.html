    <p>we each have very little control over what happens to other people or the world around us on a daily basis. But that's why casting our ballots is so crucial. Voting is an important right in our democracy because it gives us some collective say in how we want to be governed and who gets to make the big decisions that affect our society. Voting expands your personal sphere of control.
    </p>
    <p>When you vote, you are vocalizing what you need, want, and believe in. You are standing up and demanding to be counted. When you don't vote, you are silencing your heart and your conscience. Not voting is like giving your consent to the status quo (or to those you oppose), essentially saying that you don't care whether anything changes.</p>
